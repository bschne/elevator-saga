# Elevator Saga Solution
This repository contains my solution to the elevator programming game [*Elevator Saga*](http://play.elevatorsaga.com/). It is currently a work in progress and still being tweaked.

## Challenge Progress
The current algorithm passes the following challenges. Note that the challenges are partially random, so it may take more than one try to pass a challenge in some cases.

| Challenge | Condition | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Transport 15 people in 60 seconds or less | Passing |
| 2 | Transport 20 people in 60 seconds or less | Passing |
| 3 | Transport 23 people in 60 seconds or less | Passing |
| 4 | Transport 28 people in 60 seconds or less | Passing |
| 5 | Transport 100 people in 68 seconds or less | Passing |
| 6 | Transport 40 people in 60 moves or less | Passing |
| 7 | Transport 100 people in 63 moves or less | Passing |
| 8 | Transport 50 people with a maximum wait time of 21 seconds | Passing |
| 9 | Transport 50 people with a maximum wait time of 20 seconds | Passing |
| 10 | Transport 50 people in 70 seconds or less | Passing |
| 11 | Transport 60 people with a maximum wait time of 19 seconds | Passing |
| 12 | Transport 80 people with a maximum wait time of 17 seconds | Failing |
